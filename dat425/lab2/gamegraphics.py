#------------------------------------------------------
#This module contains all graphics-classes for the game
#Most classes are wrappers around model classes, e.g. 
#  * GraphicGame is a wrappoer around Game
#  * GraphicPlayer is a wrapper around Player
#  * GraphicProjectile is a wrapper around Projectile
#In addition there are two UI-classes that have no 
#counterparts in the model:
#  * Button
#  * InputDialog

# TODO: There needs to be a class called GraphicGame here. 
# Its constructor should take only a Game object.
# TODO: In addition to the methods of Game, GraphicGame needs to have a getWindow method that returns the main GraphWin object the game is played in
# HINT: Look at the other classes in this file, the GraphicGame class should "wrap around" a Game object the same way GraphicPlayer wraps around a Player
# HINT: These lines are good for creating a window:
#  win = GraphWin("Cannon game" , 640, 480, autoflush=False)
#  win.setCoords(-110, -10, 110, 155)
# HINT: Don't forget to call draw() on every component you create, otherwise they will not be visible
# HINT: You need to get the Players from the Game object (the model), wrap them into GraphicPlayers and store them, and all get-methods for players (e.g. getCurrentPlayer) must return the Graphical versions
